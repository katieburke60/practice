1. Create static version of UI

2. Create initial state (in index.js and pass as props to App.js)
- Put a fake initial state in index.js and pass to App.js as prop to get initially wired up

3. Break out the individual components and import into App.js (will need to pass down props)

4. Create a reducer that will load the initial state of the app
