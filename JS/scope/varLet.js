//var cannot be accessed outside of a function scope, but can be accessed outside of block scope.
//Let and const work the same (no access) in both.

//const is best for defining functions and requiring stuff from other libraries (i.e. cases where variables are unlikely to change)

//immutable.js is good if you need better immutability.
