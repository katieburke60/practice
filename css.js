1. Want elements to be next to eachother [Display Property]
//Block elements always reserve the entire row no matter how big they are, which makes the next element break onto another line.
//Inline: This display value only reserves the amount of space that the element actually takes up.

2. Float element outside of context of block and inline.
//When you float elements you're removing them from the standard blocking of the browser's rendering.
//So it will think that the thing that the elements are in has no content inside of it.
//Therefore you need to reserve enough space in the containing element.
